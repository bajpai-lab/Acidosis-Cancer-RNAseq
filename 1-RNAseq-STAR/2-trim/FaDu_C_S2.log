Path to Cutadapt set as: '/home/lexic/.conda/envs/pre/bin/cutadapt' (user defined)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command '/home/lexic/.conda/envs/pre/bin/cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.4
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
pigz 2.8
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 2 cores

Proceeding with 'pigz -p 2' for decompression
To decrease CPU usage of decompression, please install 'igzip' and run again

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

Output will be written into the directory: /blazer/nv/jh3/2-trim/
